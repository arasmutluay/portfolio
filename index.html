            Greetings! I'm Aras Mutluay, a dedicated Software Engineering
            Student currently living in Istanbul with a lifelong passion for
            technology and gaming. My passion for problem-solving and coding has
            driven me forward in the field of software. I'm deeply immersed in
            learning JavaScript, improving my skills to become a proficient Web
            Developer. In addition to web development and gaming, I also have a
            growing fascination with cybersecurity. As our digital world
            continues to expand, ensuring the security of online systems and
            data becomes increasingly vital. Beyond the digital realm, I've also
            been a devoted gym-goer since the age of 15. It's fascinating to me
            how working out and coding share similar principles, emphasizing the
            importance of daily repetitions and practice. This connection
            between physical fitness and software development is one of the
            variables that motivated me to pursue this career path.

        <p class="experience-title">My Working Experience</p>
        <hr class="line" />
        <div class="experience-text">
          <p>
            I worked as an engineer at a crypto-mining farm specializing in GPU
            mining for 1.5 years. During my time at work, I took on the
            responsibility of maintaining and enhancing the operational
            efficiency of the graphics cards. <br />

            Throughout this period, I did extensive experiments with various
            mining algorithms across a range of GPU models. I also adjusted
            overclocking settings for each card and algorithm to maximize
            performance and overall card optimization. <br />
            Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience by replacing numerous
            computer components, either to resolve issues or enhance the mining
            process. As part of my role, I did comprehensive testing on
            different operating systems, including Linux and Windows, to
            determine which GPU brands performed more effectively on each
            system. <br />
            Here are some of the things that I've worked on:

            This was the "AMD floor" of the farm. It consisted of 24 rigs, each
            rig had 8 GPU's on it making a total of 192 GPU's.

            This was our second floor; it housed both NVIDIA cards, primarily
            RTX 3090 models, and AMD cards. This floor experienced the most
            issues because the NVIDIA cards were overheating due to inadequate
            stock fans and other variables. We had to replace fans, adjust
            overclocking settings, and select algorithms specific to the RTX
            3090 cards. Eventually, we implemented a ventilation system for the
            farm since, at one point, temperatures were reaching 60Â°C.

            This is a turbine for a Hydropower Plant. We moved the farm to a
            hydroelectric power plant to solve electricity, which is the biggest
            part of the cost.
