                    Greetings! I'm Aras Mutluay, a dedicated Software Engineering
                    Student currently living in Istanbul with a lifelong passion for
                    technology and gaming. My passion for problem-solving and coding has
                    driven me forward in the field of software. I'm deeply immersed in
                    learning JavaScript, improving my skills to become a proficient Web
                    Developer. In addition to web development and gaming, I also have a
                    growing fascination with cybersecurity. As our digital world
                    continues to expand, ensuring the security of online systems and
                    data becomes increasingly vital. Beyond the digital realm, I've also
                    been a devoted gym-goer since the age of 15. It's fascinating to me
                    how working out and coding share similar principles, emphasizing the
                    importance of daily repetitions and practice. This connection
                    between physical fitness and software development is one of the
                    variables that motivated me to pursue this career path.

            <p class="experience-title">My Working Experience</p>
            <hr class="line" />
            <div class="experience-text">
                <p>
                    I worked as an engineer at a crypto-mining farm specializing in GPU
                    mining for 1.5 years. During my time at work, I took on the
                    responsibility of maintaining and enhancing the operational
                    efficiency of the graphics cards. <br />

                    Throughout this period, I did extensive experiments with various
                    mining algorithms across a range of GPU models. I also adjusted
                    overclocking settings for each card and algorithm to maximize
                    performance and overall card optimization. <br />
                    Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience by replacing numerous
                    computer components, either to resolve issues or enhance the mining
                    process. As part of my role, I did comprehensive testing on
                    different operating systems, including Linux and Windows, to
                    determine which GPU brands performed more effectively on each
                    system. <br />
                    Here are some of the things that I've worked on:

                <p class="photo1-text">
                    This was the "AMD floor" of the farm. It consisted of 24 rigs, each
                    rig had 8 GPU's on it making a total of 192 GPU's.
                </p>

            <div class="experience-content">

                <p class="photo1-text">
                    This was our second floor; it housed both NVIDIA cards, primarily
                    RTX 3090 models, and AMD cards. This floor experienced the most
                    issues because the NVIDIA cards were overheating due to inadequate
                    stock fans and other variables. We had to replace fans, adjust
                    overclocking settings, and select algorithms specific to the RTX
                    3090 cards. Eventually, we implemented a ventilation system for the
                    farm since, at one point, temperatures were reaching 60Â°C.

                <p class="photo1-text">
                    This is a turbine for a Hydropower Plant. We moved the farm to a
                    hydroelectric power plant to solve electricity, which is the biggest
                    part of the cost.

                            CSS, and JavaScript. I've completed various small projects and
                            gained experience in front-end development.

                            I've used Bootstrap to create responsive and visually appealing
                            web designs. Bootstrap's grid system and components have been
                            helpful in building responsive layouts. However, in this
                            portfolio, I've used plain CSS.

                            I've worked on some web projects using JavaScript to add
                            interactivity and enhance user experience. Projects were little
                            games such as a piano-playing website, a color memory game, and
                            a dice game, etc.

                            We primarily used Java during my time in university. I learned
                            fundamental concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation,
                            inheritance, and polymorphism and completed numerous projects
                            during my university years. However, I don't enjoy coding in
                            Java as I find it exhausting.

                            On the side, I've always been interested in Python. I've worked
                            on several CSV files and completed a Data Analysis project about
                            electricity prices in Turkey, using the pandas library.
