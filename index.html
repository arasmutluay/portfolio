            Greetings! I'm Aras Mutluay, a dedicated Software Engineering
            Student with a lifelong passion for technology and gaming. My
            passion for problem-solving and coding has driven me forward in the
            field of software. Beyond the digital realm, I've also been a
            devoted gym-goer since the age of 15. It's fascinating to me how
            working out and coding share similar principles, emphasizing the
            importance of daily repetitions and practice. This connection
            between physical fitness and software development is one of the
            variables that motivated me to pursue this career path.

        <p class="experience-title">My Working Experience</p>
        <div class="experience-text">
          <p>
            I worked as an engineer at a crypto-mining farm specializing in GPU
            mining for 1.5 years. During my time at work, I took on the
            responsibility of maintaining and enhancing the operational
            efficiency of the graphics cards. <br />

            Throughout this period, I did extensive experiments with various
            mining algorithms across a range of GPU models. I also adjusted
            overclocking settings for each card and algorithm to maximize
            performance and overall card optimization. <br />
            Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience by replacing numerous
            computer components, either to resolve issues or enhance the mining
            process. As part of my role, I did comprehensive testing on
            different operating systems, including Linux and Windows, to
            determine which GPU brands performed more effectively on each
            system. <br />
            Here are some of the things that I've worked on:

          <p class="photo1-text">
            This was the "AMD floor" of the farm. It consisted of 24 rigs, each
            rig had 8 GPU's on it making a total of 192 GPU's.
